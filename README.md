## Objective
To design and implement an automated data pipeline for ServiceNow data, enabling efficient data integration, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights for decision-making.

## Description 
The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing ServiceNow data by developing a fully automated ETL pipeline using SSIS and SQL Server. The raw data was extracted from Excel, transformed, and loaded into SQL Server while maintaining data integrity through merge queries. Key trends and patterns were identified using SQL exploratory analysis. A Power BI dashboard was developed to provide interactive visualizations, enabling stakeholders to monitor key performance metrics and gain actionable insights from ServiceNow data.

## Tools Used 
- MS Excel – Source Data Storage
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Visual Studio – Data Extraction and Integration
- SQL Server – Data Storage and Exploratory Analysis
- Power BI – Data Visualization and Reporting

## SSIS 
### Data Extraction and Integration
